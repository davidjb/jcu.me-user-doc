FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)
=================================

Why can't I see my profile?
---------------------------

Firstly check to ensure your profile is not hidden; note that adjunct staff
are hidden by default.  Try logging into the Research Portfolio and searching
for your name.  If you can find yourself, then see :ref:`profile-settings` for
how to change this setting.

If this reveals no profile, then you are not currently classed as an active
researcher and therefore do not have a profile at this stage. Refer to the
details about :ref:`active-researcher` for the relevant conditions that must
be met for a profile and :ref:`no-profile` for more information.

When will my profile be created?
--------------------------------

Your profile will be created automatically as long as you meet the criteria
for an :ref:`active-researcher`.

How do I fix information on my profile?
---------------------------------------

See :ref:`edit-profile`.

When to changes take effect?
----------------------------

Any recent changes will be pushed to the |project-name| on the weekend
following their update, so new profiles are available on the coming Monday.

Refer to :ref:`data-sources` for more information.

What happens if some of my publications are not public access?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The publication page from ResearchOnline@JCU is displayed when the publication
title link is clicked. This page shows that it is Repository staff only and
shows the ``Request a copy`` button. Once selected, the user is directed to a
form to request access to the publication.

I collaborate with a lot of institutions and people; why isn't my tab/map displayed?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You must collaborate with institutions and people from at least 3 different
regions (states or countries) for the tab and map to display.

Why are no names of students listed under my Supervision section?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The University's interpretation of the `Queensland Right to Information Act
2009`_ and the `Queensland Information Privacy Act 2009`_ is to ensure the
privacy of our students. Hence, student details may only be used if their
consent has been provided. Refer to the University's `Information Privacy
Policy`_ for further clarification.

Staff details are made accessible via the public JCU website, because they are
employees of the University and are expected to be accessible as points of
contact for the services they provide.

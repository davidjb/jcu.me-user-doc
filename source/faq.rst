Frequently Asked Questions - FAQ
================================

I've created a page, but my custom script/embed/Flash/widget is being stripped
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, |project-name| is configured to strip out all potentially dangerous
HTML from content being included.  The reason for this is that untrusted input,
especially from ``iframe`` and ``script`` elements can compromise site
security.

Contact your site administrator for more information and details about what
other options you may have for including your content.

    The title bar covers or obscures my logo
    ----------------------------------------

    The title bar layout applies to all areas on |project-name| and is designed
    for improve accessibilty. If your logo is hidden or obscured as shown
    below, we recommend reducing the number of first level items in your site
    and keeping content titles *short* and *descriptive*.

       :alt: My logo is obscured
       :align: center
       :scale: 50%

    The top-level navigation items also represent the menu on mobile devices.
    Due to limited space on these smaller screens, keeping the length and
    number of top-level navigation tabs down will improve the experience for
    your visitors.

    Here are some suggestions for improving your site at the same time:

    #. Structure and group content into logically-separated areas, using
       folders at the top-level of the site.
    #. Use clear, concise titles for your folders to explain what is inside.
    #. Always ensure your content is placed into the correct areas within
       your site. This will ensure the site stays well-structured.

    The same philosophies are applicable to other web-based systems as well,
    not just |project-name|.  Following these suggestions will aid in the
    usability and presentation of your site and at the same time ensure your
    logo is visible.

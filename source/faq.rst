The title bar is hiding my logo
-------------------------------

The title bar layout applies to all eSpaces and is designed for improve accessibilty. If your logo is 
hidden or obscured as shown below, eSpaces recommends reducing the number of first level items in your 
eSpace and keeping the titles short and descriptive.

   :alt: My logo is obscured
   :align: center
   :scale: 50%
   
Our suggestion is to group content into separate logical areas. The top level navigation items
in an eSpace also represent the menu on mobile devices and thus should be kept to a minimum. 
Following these suggestions will aid in the usability and presentation of your site and ensure 
your logo is visible.

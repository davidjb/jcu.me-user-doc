Each type of folder view can easily be tested and changed as required.


Deselecting a default view
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a folder has a default view configured, you can de-select this by
simply selecting another `Display View`_.  If you'd like the default
appearance for a folder to be restored, choose ``Summary view``.


Sorting a folder
----------------

Using the ``Contents`` view for a folder, you can manually drag-and-drop the
content items in any particular order you'd like.  However, if you'd like
to simplify this process, you can sort a folder's contents automatically
on one of a number of criteria.  This is particularly helpful if you have
many folder items and they need to be sorted by title, modification date
or similar.  To do this:

#. Browse to the main view of the folder you wish to modify. Make sure you're
   looking at the folder with the ``View`` tab selected.

#. Click the ``Actions`` drop-down menu and click ``

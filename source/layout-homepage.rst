Change the home page for a folder
=================================

By default Plone displays a list of the contents of all folders and a brief
description. In order to change this view, you will need to create a new page
and set the folder to use this page as the default view for the folder.


1. After logging in to the portal, click into the folder you'd like to change.
   Make sure you've already created a page to set as its default view.
2. Click on the Display menu and pick "Select a content item as default view"

   :alt: select_content_item
   :align: center

3. Select the item that you would like to be displayed as the default page of
   the folder and click the **Save**  button.
4. You should now be able to see the page appear as the default view for the
   folder. Keep in mind that you will need to publish this page for other
   users to see it.

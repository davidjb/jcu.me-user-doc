Introducing Plone
*****************

What is eSpaces?
================
*Introduction*

Collaborative data sharing is a key area of interest for many researchers and
graduate students. This portal provides a web-based solution for managing data
and file storage, messaging, project management and more.

This site uses an open-source content management system called
`Plone <http://www.plone.org>`_ to allow researchers to easily share content,
files and other digital objects within a web environment without needing to
learn web authoring technologies.

Researchers can use Plone as an access point to data and file storage,
collaboration and project management tools. Plone provides a simple method to
upload files and annotate them with comments between users.

Site Layout: An Introduction
============================
*Details about how the site is laid out and what features are available.*

1. **Top navigation tabs** 
   The top navigation tabs are the top-level of navigation on the portal. 
   Primary folders or other types of content can be added or changed here 
   with appropriate permissions. For the public or normal users, however, 
   these serve as a quick way to access the main areas of information on 
   the portal. 
2. **Content management tools** 
   Here you will find tools for editing and viewing documents to which 
   you have access. If you don't see this bar of tabs, then you don't have 
   access to perform any actions on the given piece of content that you're 
   looking at. 
3. **Plone menu bar** 
   Contains the menus for adding new content to folders, or otherwise 
   setting how a piece of content is displayed or the workflow state of an 
   item. 
4. **LiveSearch** 
   A search engine that allows users to search your site for content.
5. **Main page content** 
   The main area on the page for your content. If you are looking at a folder, 
   you might see a listing of folder contents here instead, rather than just
   a single page. Otherwise, you'll see the details about the current piece
   of content you're looking at. 
6. **Portlets** 
   Small mini 'windows' of information that are typically configured to 
   display snippets of information from another area on the site. One such 
   example is a 'News' portlet, which aggregates information from the 'News'
   section of the site. 
7. **Personal menu** 
   Contains links for logging in and out, access to your folder and your 
   personal preferences for display of the site. 

.. 8. **Help menu** 
..   Contains general site links of importance. Some of these may change 
..   depending on your access rights.

**LiveSearch**  box at the right of the screen. Just type in a name, and it
will find all the related documents.

There are many types of documents that can be viewed, downloaded or commented
upon with the site.

* **Page** - Can be text, images and other HTML
* **File** - A piece of content, can be uploaded from another source
* **Folder** - Similar to a folder on a hard drive, can contain content
* **Image** - Usually ends with the extension gif, png, tif or pict

.. Name changes
.. ============

.. *If for some reason, you have had your name changed, then you should follow the steps below.*

.. You'll have to get into contact with your site administrator to have your 
.. name changed. If you don't know who they are, you can usually get into
.. contact with the relevant person by using the 'Contact' link on your site.

.. Once you've talked to them about the change, you can follow the steps under the 
.. next section to complete your change of name on the system.

.. Manual Changes
.. --------------

.. The only **manual change** you need to make is to the title of your user
.. folder. The system saves your name as the folder's title when your account
.. is first created and it won't automatically update if your name changes. To change
.. the name of your folder:

.. * Log into your given Plone site.
.. * Click onto the 'My folder' link on your user actions bar (near your name and
.. the 'Log out' link).
.. * Click onto the 'Edit' tab.
.. * Edit the title of the folder appropriately to reflect your new name.
.. * Click the 'Save' button.

.. That's it.

Logging in
==========

*The first key step to accessing the system is the login process.*

In order for you to create an eSpace, access existing secured content,
add or edit files and pages, or perform any other content-related tasks,
you must first log in.  In order to share content with colleagues, each
person must log in to eSpaces at least once before they become visible.

Most users will use their existing institutional username and password (or
other credentials) to log in via the :term:`Australian Access Federation
(AAF)`.

      If your institution or organisation doesn't appear in the list,
      then you should contact your IT support staff about whether you
      are part of the :term:`Australian Access Federation (AAF)`. If you 
      are a collaborator associated with an organisation subscribed to the
      AAF, then you can obtain an AAF Virtual Home account by following
      the instructions in the `AAF Virtual Home User Guide
      <https://vho.aaf.edu.au/guides/user-guide.pdf>`_.

AAF Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since authentication is provided by your institution directly, please refer
to your local IT helpdesk for troubleshooting and password reset requests. 


Local Login
~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are unable to login to the portal, you may have forgotten your password.
If you believe this is the case, click onto the 'Local Login' link, and
then click on 'Forgot your password?' and follow the steps.

If you still can't log in, or have forgotten your username, then contact
the site administration for assistance.

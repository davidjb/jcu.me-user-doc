**The Research Portfolio is the flagship web application which promotes and
facilitates research activities within James Cook University.**

Each :ref:`active researcher <active-researcher>` in the University has a
profile within the Research Portfolio, displayed alongside tools for exploring
the University's research efforts.

Each researcher profile contains information taken from many different
existing sources, along with additional information provided by each
individual. The Research Portfolio allows researchers and nominated college or
division staff to live-update profiles by making changes and adding details to
the following:

* Biography
* Photo
* Researcher experience
* Personal and professional interests
* Honours, awards and memberships
* Identities, such as social media and publication identifiers

There is no limit to how often or how frequently this information can be
updated.  In fact, the more often a profile is updated, the more frequently it
will be seen on the front page.  By updating your profile regularly you are
promoting yourself and your research interests through up-to-date information.

This documentation covers various aspects of the Research Portfolio,
including:

* Profile editing
* Profile style
* Features
* Data description and management
* Technical details of operation for Research Portfolio Officers

This aims to serve as a reference for Research Portfolio officers when they
are updating profile pages for researchers in their division or college.

Introducing eSpaces and Plone
*****************************

What is eSpaces?
================

eSpaces is an intuitive web platform for research collaboration and data
sharing.

Researchers can easily create eSpaces – web-based sites – that allow content,
files, and pages to be stored securely, with the flexibility of access via the
web and mobile devices. The system also provides granular permissions, allowing a
range of types of security. This makes eSpaces perfect for spanning a range of
researcher needs:

 * Public-facing research portfolios
 * Project pages
 * Secure collaborative environments
 * ...anything in between.

Use eSpaces as an access point for data and file storage, discuss and 
collaborate around content, and more. eSpaces provides simple methods of
uploadng files and annotating them with comments between users.

This site uses an open-source Content Management System (CMS) called
`Plone <http://www.plone.org>`_ to allow researchers to easily share content,
files and other digital objects within a web environment without needing to
learn web authoring technologies.

Site Layout: An Introduction
============================

Each eSpace will be laid out in a similar fashion to that shown below,
depending on what features enabled by its creators. Remember that
individual sites will look slightly different as both content and
overall theme (fonts, colours, layout) can change between sites.

1. **Top navigation tabs** 
   Links across the top of a page are the top-level of navigation. 
   Primary folders or other types of content can be added or changed here 
   with appropriate permissions. For the public or normal users, however, 
   these serve as a quick way to access the main areas of information on 
   the portal. 

2. **Content management views** 
   These are the tools for editing and managing content that you have
   access to. If this set of tabs isn't present, then it is likely that
   only view access has been granted to the current folder or content.

3. **Content action menus** 
   These sets of menus perform various actions relating to the management
   of content:
   
   State
      This controls the workflow state (and thus permissions) for content
   Add new
      Allows the creation and uploading of new content, images, folders
      and more.
   Display
      Controls the appearance of a folder or a content item. For example,
      folders can be configured to show dynamic listings or tables, or
      have a content item show as the "home page". 
   Actions
      Provides the ability to cut, copy, and paste content items
      within a site, as well as the ability to delete and rename items.

4. **Search** 
   A search engine for content on the site.  Users can enter keywords
   from any part of content, including titles, descriptions, and
   text to find results.
   
5. **Main page content** 
   The main body of information on a given page is displayed here,
   which will change dependent on the type of content being viewed.
   If the current piece of content is a page, then the body of the document
   will be displayed.  If the current item is an image, then picture metadata
   will be shown. If the current page is a folder, then this may display a
   listing of content present rather than just a single page.

6. **Portlets** 
   Small windows of information may be configured on the left or right-hand
   side of any page.  Portlets typically display snippets of content
   and links to other information on a site. One such example is a 'News'
   portlet, which will aggregrate information about news items that exist
   elsewhere in the site. There are a number of different types of portlets
   available by default, and some can pull in information from external
   sources like RSS feeds.

7. **Personal menu** 
   Clicking on this drop-down menu reveals access to personal preferences,
   the user dashboard, and the ability to log out. Certain other options
   may be available depending on your level of access.


Starting with content
=====================
   
There are many types of content that can be created, viewed, downloaded or 
commented upon with a site, including:

Page
   The main content for a site is contained within Pages, which can feature
   text, images, hyperlinks, and other rich HTML.
File
   Individual content uploaded from a local computer. Users may download
   or access the given file via links inside Pages or directly from Folder
   listings.
Folder
   Similar to that on a hard drive, folders contain content and are
   used to give a site structure.  Folders can be nested to any depth
   required.
Image
   Storage type for pictures uploaded from a local computer.
   Images can be inserted into Page content, displayed in albums and lists,
   and otherwise stored for viewing.  Supported image types include JPEG,
   GIF, PNG and TIFF.
Link
   Automatic link to another web address, which may be another item
   in the portal or to an external resource.

For more information about content management, see
:ref:`adding-and-editing-content`.


Navigation within the site
==========================

eSpaces are similar to other sites and web-based systems: they consist
of structure and content. For example, a site may have any number of folders,
images, pages, files, and other types of content. The structure can be nested
in any format, and as deep as required, much like structuring a computer
hard drive or network share.

As new content is added, it will appear either in the top-level navigation
of the site, or if placed into sub-folders and nested, then in the Navigation
portlet listing, which appears automatically as required. 

Read more about :ref:`customising-layout-design`. 

If unsure of the location of a particular file or folder, use the
**Search**  box at the top of an page. Just type in a name or keyword, and 
a list of all related documents will be displayed.

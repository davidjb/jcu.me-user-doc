Setting personal preferences
============================


Each person with an account on Plone has their own folder. Your content will
be stored there, and you can create other sub-folders to organize your data.

1. To access your folder, click the **my folder** link on the personal toolbar.
2. To edit your preferences, click the **preferences** link on the personal bar
3. If you click **Personal Preferences** you will be taken to a page where you
   can set individual values for your folder. These are stored on the Plone
   server, and will be available regardless of the machine that you use to login.
4. For example, at the bottom of the page you can choose the photo to appear
   on your profile page. Just click the **browse** button, and select the
   correct image file.
5. Click the Save button at the bottom of the page to save your changes.

You can set your preferences for all of the items listed below:

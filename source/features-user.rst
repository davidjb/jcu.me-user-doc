Changing your password
----------------------

.. ifconfig:: metadata['project']['auth'] == 'aaf'

    On |project-name|, authentication occurs either with existing
    research institution credentials using Single-Sign-On, or with local
    accounts that are independently managed inside |project-name|.

    If your credentials were issued by a research institution, then
    contact that institution's IT support or help desk to help you
    manage your account and password.

    If your credentials are local to |project-name|, then proceed with
    the following instructions:


#. On |project-name|, ensure that you are logged in.

#. Click onto the top-right menu showing your name.

#. Click ``Preferences``.

#. Click on the ``Password`` tab.

#. Enter your existing password and the new password you want for your
   account.

#. Click ``Change password`` to make the change.  Remember to use this
   next time you log in.

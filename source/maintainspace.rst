Maintaining an eSpace
=====================

Creating an eSpace
------------------

1. After logging in, the first thing to do is create your eSpace.
   Click on *Create an eSpace* on the top menu.
2. The next step is to complete the following fields:

+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Metadata    | Description                                         |
+=============+=====================================================+
| Space ID    | This is the unique name that identifies your space. |
|             | It forms part of your eSpace URL, so ensure you use |
|             | a meaningful ID that describes your eSpace and is   |
|             | easy for users to remember.                         |
+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Space Title | The textual title of an eSpace, displayed in web    | 
|             | search results and in eSpace listings.              | 
+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

3. Click on *Create* and wait a moment as your eSpace is created.
   Once finished, the page will reload and you'll be able to get started!

Deleting an eSpace
------------------

In case you decide that you no longer require your eSpace, and are sure
that you have a backup of any information that was previously stored
there, you can `contact us <https://www.espaces.edu.au/contact-info>`_
with your request.  We'll confirm this request with any other administrators
that are also part of your eSpace.

This process may take a little while to enact.  Please also remember that
if you have had any information publically accessible that web search
engines and other third parties likely have taken copies of the information
since it was made available.

Editing an eSpace
-----------------

After logging in to eSpaces, and having created your eSpace, you can add some
customisations.

#. On the Home page of your eSpace, click on the *Edit* tab.

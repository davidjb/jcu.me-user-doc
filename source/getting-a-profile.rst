Getting a profile
=================

.. _active-researchers:

Who is considered an *active researcher*?
-----------------------------------------

Profiles are automatically created for *active researchers* at the University.
An active researcher is defined as someone who is the following:

* A current member of staff;
* Is not a casual staff member;
* Holds a position that is classified as academic (AC) or research (RS),
  except general research staff (award type of RESG); and
* Has at least one visible publication in the JCU publication repository,
  `ResearchOnline@JCU`_.

If you need to deposit publications into `ResearchOnline@JCU`_, you, or
someone on your behalf, can do so online.

Adjuncts
~~~~~~~~

For researchers that hold adjunct positions, a profile is
created for those that:

* Have at least one visible publication in the JCU publication repository,
  `ResearchOnline@JCU`_; and
* Are part of a current grant, or currently supervising a HDR student.

This profile is *initially hidden*, so in order to be seen publicly you will
need to :ref:`edit your profile <edit-profile>`.

Special situtations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Profiles are also created for research managers (such as College Deans,
Pro-Vice Chancellors and Academic Deans of Research) and Emeritus Professors,
provided one visible publication is stored in `ResearchOnline@JCU`_.

Can't see your profile?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your profile doesn't appear to be present, check through each of the points
above. For a profile to appear, all information in the respective central
database or system must be correct and up-to-date.  Any recent changes will be
pushed to the |project-name| on the weekend following their update, so new
profiles are available on the coming Monday.

Refer to :ref:`data-sources` for more information.

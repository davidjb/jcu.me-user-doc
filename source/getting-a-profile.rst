Getting a profile
=================

.. _active-researchers:

Who is considered an *active researcher*?
-----------------------------------------

Profiles are automatically created for *active researchers* at the University.
An active researcher is defined as someone who is the following:

* A current member of staff;
* Is not a casual staff member;
* Holds a position that is classified as academic (AC) or research (RS),
  except general research staff (award type of RESG); and
* Has at least one visible (non-thesis) publication in the JCU publication repository,
  `ResearchOnline@JCU`_.
  
  * *Note: A thesis is an unpublished work and will not be included in the set of publications shown.*

If you need to deposit publications into `ResearchOnline@JCU`_, you, or
someone on your behalf, can do so online.

Adjuncts
~~~~~~~~

For researchers that hold adjunct positions, a profile is
created for those that:

* Have at least one visible (non-thesis) publication in the JCU publication repository,
  `ResearchOnline@JCU`_; and
* Are a principal investigator of a current grant, or currently supervising a :abbr:`HDR (Higher
  Degree Research)` student, or have at least 5 ERA-eligible publications in the last 5 years where at least one of these outputs is co-authored with a current (non-adjunct) JCU researcher.

This profile is *initially hidden*, so in order to be seen publicly you will
need to :ref:`edit your profile <edit-profile>`.

Special situtations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Profiles are also created for research managers (such as College Deans,
Pro-Vice Chancellors and Academic Deans of Research) and Emeritus Professors,
provided one visible publication is stored in `ResearchOnline@JCU`_.

.. _no-profile:

Can't see your profile?
-----------------------

If your profile doesn't appear to be present, check through each of the points
above. For a profile to appear, all information in the respective central
database or system must be correct and up-to-date. Once data has been updated
in the relevant central system, updates occur :ref:`perodically
<recent-changes>`.

If, after checking all your data, you think you should have a profile but it's not there, please email research.portfolio@jcu.edu.au.

Requesting a Profile
--------------------

In the case where you don't meet the criteria for a profile, you can apply for an exception to be made. You will need a letter of support from your College Dean or Director and articulate the benefit to your College/Directorate and the University that would come from you having a public profile.  Email your request to the Dean of Research and copy in research.information@jcu.edu.au. If the Dean of Research grants the exception, the Research Information team will ensure that your portfolio page is created on the next data update.

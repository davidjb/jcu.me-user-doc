Navigation within Plone
=======================

Each person with an account on the portal will have a private folder called
**My Folder** . To go to your folder, click the **My Folder**  link on the
Personal Bar.

To view the public documents in another folder, click on the folder to view
the contents.

If you are not sure where a particular file resides, you can use the
**LiveSearch**  box at the left of the screen. Just type in a name, and it
will find all the related documents.

There are many types of documents that can be viewed, downloaded or commented
upon with the site.

    item

Name changes
============

.. If for some reason, you have had your name changed, then you should follow
   the steps below.

You'll have to get into contact with your site administrator to have your
name changed. If you don't know who they are, you can usually get into
contact with the relevant person by using the 'Contact' link on your site.

Once you've talked to them about the change, you can follow the steps above
under the next section to complete your change of name on the system.

Manual Changes
--------------

The only **manual change**  you need to make is to the title of your user
folder. The system saves your name as the folder's title by default, thus
meaning it won't automatically update if your name does change. To change
the name of your folder:

* Log into your given Plone site.
* Click onto the 'My folder' link on your user actions bar (near your name and
  the 'Log out' link).
* Click onto the 'Edit' tab.
* Edit the title of the folder appropriately to reflect your new name.
* Click the 'Save' button.

That's it.

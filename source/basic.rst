What is Plone?
**************

Introduction
============

Collaborative data sharing is a key area of interest for many researchers and
graduate students. This portal provides a web-based solution for managing data
and file storage, messaging, project management and more.

This site uses an open-source content management system called 
`Plone <http://www.plone.org>`_ to allow researchers to easily share content, 
files and other digital objects within a web environment without needing to 
learn web authoring technologies.

Researchers can use Plone as an access point to data and file storage, 
collaboration and project management tools. Plone provides a simple method to
upload files and annotate them with comments between users.


Site Layout: An Introduction
=================================
.. Details about how the site is laid out and what features are available.

**Top navigation tabs** 
   The top navigation tabs are the top-level of navigation on the portal. 
   Primary folders or other types of content can be added or changed here 
   with appropriate permissions. For the public or normal users, however, 
   these serve as a quick way to access the main areas of information on 
   the portal. 
**Content management tools** 
   Here you will find tools for editing and viewing documents to which 
   you have access. If you don't see this bar of tabs, then you don't have 
   access to perform any actions on the given piece of content that you're 
   looking at. 
**Plone menu bar** 
   Contains the menus for adding new content to folders, or otherwise 
   setting how a piece of content is displayed or the workflow state of an 
   item. 
**LiveSearch** 
   A dynamic search engine that automatically updates the search results 
   as you type a string in the search box. 
**Main page content** 
   The main area on the page for your content. If you are looking at folder, 
   you might see a listing of folder contents here instead, rather than just
   a single page. Otherwise, you'll see the details about the current piece
   of content you're looking at. 
**Portlets** 
   Small mini 'windows' of information that are typically configured to 
   display snippets of information from another area on the site. One such 
   example is a 'News' portlet, which aggregates information from the 'News'
   section of the site. 
**Personal bar** 
   Contains links for logging in and out, access to your folder and your 
   personal preferences for display of the site. 
**Site links** 
   Contains general site links of importance.\Some of these may change 
   depending on your access rights.

link the bottom right, and then read the instructions under 'Forgot your 
password?'. Follow these steps to try and change your password.

If you still can't log in, then contact your site administrator for assistance.


Navigation within Plone
============================

Each person with an account on the portal will have a private folder called 
**"My Folder"** . To go to your folder, click the **My Folder**  link on the
Personal Bar.

To view the public documents in another folder, click on the folder to view 
the contents.

If you are not sure where a particular file resides, you can use the 
**LiveSearch**  box at the left of the screen. Just type in a name, and it 
will find all the related documents.

There are many types of documents that can be viewed, downloaded or commented
upon with the site.

 * **Page** -- Can be text, images and other HTML
 * **File** -- A piece of content, can be uploaded from another source
 * **Folder** -- Similar to a folder on a hard drive, can contain content
 * **Image** -- Usually ends with the extension gif, png, tif or pict
 * **Link** -- Hypertext link to another item in the portal or to an external
   item


Using the Dashboard
===================

The portal has several built-in "views" of news, events, recently changed 
items, and such. These list views are held in discrete rectangular areas
called portlets. Think of a portlet as a window view of a given type of 
content. For example, the news portlet offers a view of recently published
news items.

You control which portlets you view in your dashboard, and where they are
placed. The following screen capture shows what one user\might see on their
dashboard:

.. image:: images/dashboard.png
   :alt: Dashboard


Accessing the dashboard
-----------------------

1. Click onto your own name in your user actions toolbar (at the bottom of
   the site).
2. This is your dashboard.


Editing your dashboard
----------------------

1. Once you are looking at your dashboard, click the 'Edit' tab at the top.
2. You can now select new porlets for your dashboard or reorganise the ones
   that already exist.


Details about dashboards
------------------------

A new user account on the portal will have a dashboard similar the one shown.
Depending on what is installed for the site, the user can customise the
portlets they want to see and where to place them within the four columns.

So, for the typical user account, the dashboard would start with the portlets
shown above, and later would be "populated" as news items, events, and other
content items are added to the web site.


Folder display options
===========================

Display View
------------
The portal allows you to pick several ways to display the contents of a
folder. The standard view is listed below. To change the view, click the
display menu item from the Plone menu bar and choose the appropriate view
from the list.

Change the home page for a folder
=================================

By default Plone displays a list of the contents of all folders and a brief
description. In order to change this view, you will need to create a new page
and set the folder to use this page as the default view for the folder.


1. After logging in to the portal, click into the folder you'd like to change.
   Make sure you've already created a page to set as its default view.
2. Click on the Display menu and pick "Select a content item as default view"

.. image:: images/display_menu_closeup.jpg
   :alt: Display Menu Closeup

3. Select the item that you would like to be displayed as the default page of
   the folder and click the **Save**  button.
4. You should now be able to see the page appear as the default view for the
   folder. Keep in mind that you will need to publish this page for other
   users to see it.


Name changes
============
.. If for some reason, you have had your name changed, then you should follow the steps below.

You'll have to get into contact with your site administrator to have your
name changed. If you don't know who they are, you can usually get into
contact with the relevant person by using the 'Contact' link on your site.

Once you've talked to them about the change, you can follow the steps above
under the next section to complete your change of name on the system.

Manual Changes
--------------

The only **manual change**  you need to make is to the title of your user
folder. The system saves your name as the folder's title by default, thus
meaning it won't automatically update if your name does change. To change
the name of your folder:

* Log into your given Plone site
* Click onto the 'My folder' link on your user actions bar (near your name and
  the 'Log out' link)
* Click onto the 'Edit' tab
* Edit the title of the folder appropriately to reflect your new name
* Click the 'Save' button.

That's it.

link the bottom right, and then read the instructions under 'Forgot your 
password?'. Follow these steps to try and change your password.

If you still can't log in, then contact your site administrator for assistance.


Using the Dashboard
===================

The portal has several built-in "views" of news, events, recently changed 
items, and such. These list views are held in discrete rectangular areas
called portlets. Think of a portlet as a window view of a given type of 
content. For example, the news portlet offers a view of recently published
news items.

You control which portlets you view in your dashboard, and where they are
placed. The following screen capture shows what one user\might see on their
dashboard:

.. image:: images/dashboard.png
   :alt: Dashboard


Accessing the dashboard
-----------------------

1. Click onto your own name in your user actions toolbar (at the bottom of
   the site).
2. This is your dashboard.


Editing your dashboard
----------------------

1. Once you are looking at your dashboard, click the 'Edit' tab at the top.
2. You can now select new porlets for your dashboard or reorganise the ones
   that already exist.


Details about dashboards
------------------------

A new user account on the portal will have a dashboard similar the one shown.
Depending on what is installed for the site, the user can customise the
portlets they want to see and where to place them within the four columns.

So, for the typical user account, the dashboard would start with the portlets
shown above, and later would be "populated" as news items, events, and other
content items are added to the web site.


Folder display options
===========================

Display View
------------
The portal allows you to pick several ways to display the contents of a
folder. The standard view is listed below. To change the view, click the
display menu item from the Plone menu bar and choose the appropriate view
from the list.

Change the home page for a folder
=================================

By default Plone displays a list of the contents of all folders and a brief
description. In order to change this view, you will need to create a new page
and set the folder to use this page as the default view for the folder.


1. After logging in to the portal, click into the folder you'd like to change.
   Make sure you've already created a page to set as its default view.
2. Click on the Display menu and pick "Select a content item as default view"

.. image:: images/display_menu_closeup.jpg
   :alt: Display Menu Closeup

3. Select the item that you would like to be displayed as the default page of
   the folder and click the **Save**  button.
4. You should now be able to see the page appear as the default view for the
   folder. Keep in mind that you will need to publish this page for other
   users to see it.


Name changes
============
.. If for some reason, you have had your name changed, then you should follow the steps below.

You'll have to get into contact with your site administrator to have your
name changed. If you don't know who they are, you can usually get into
contact with the relevant person by using the 'Contact' link on your site.

Once you've talked to them about the change, you can follow the steps above
under the next section to complete your change of name on the system.

Manual Changes
--------------

The only **manual change**  you need to make is to the title of your user
folder. The system saves your name as the folder's title by default, thus
meaning it won't automatically update if your name does change. To change
the name of your folder:

* Log into your given Plone site
* Click onto the 'My folder' link on your user actions bar (near your name and
  the 'Log out' link)
* Click onto the 'Edit' tab
* Edit the title of the folder appropriately to reflect your new name
* Click the 'Save' button.

That's it.

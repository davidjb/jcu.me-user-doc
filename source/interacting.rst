Comments are an important part of collaboration and allow you to provide
feedback or visibly expression opinions.

With the exception of folders, almost all types of content can be enabled to
allow comments. If comments are enabled for a particular content item you will
see a comments section underneath the content, and an ``Add comment`` button.
If this isn't visible, see `Enabling or disabling comments`_ for how to turn
commenting on.


Enabling or disabling comments
------------------------------

.. note::
    You requre access to edit a given content item in order to control comments.


#. Browse to the content item you wish to adjust comments for.

#. Click on the ``Edit`` tab.

#. Click onto the ``Settings`` tab on the page to reveal extra settings
   for this content.

#. Enable or disable the ``Allow comments`` field as required.

   If you can't find the field here, it might be under a different tab, such as
   ``Properties``. Some custom content types can adjust where options are
   displayed.

#. Click the ``Save`` button to make the change.

#. The page will reload and display your content with its new settings applied.


If you enabled commenting, the comments field will be displayed.  Likewise, if
you disabled commenting, comments will no longer be shown and the ability to
add comments will be removed.


Adding comments
---------------

.. note::
   The content item you wish to add comments to must have commenting enabled
   first.

#. Browse to the content item you wish to add a comment to.

#. Locate the *Comments* section at the bottom of the page. Depending on how
   long your page content is, you may need to scroll down the page.

#. Type your comments in to the field provided.

#. To save the comment, click the ``Comment`` button. You have the option of
   having |project-name| notify you via email of new comments made on the
   content by selecting the option provided.

#. Your comments will appear underneath the content on the page.


Replying to comments
--------------------

Replying to existing comments follows the same process as `Adding comments`_
above. 

#. Browse to the content item you wish to add a comment to.

#. Locate the *Comments* section at the bottom of the page. Depending on how
   long your page content is, you may need to scroll down the page.

#. Locate the comment that you wish to respond to and click the ``Reply``
   button against the comment.

#. Follow the remaining steps for `Adding comments`_.


Removing comments
-----------------

.. note::
   You must have access as a ``Reviewer`` (*Can Review* permission) in order to
   remove existing comments from content.  If you cannot see the ``Delete``
   button, you need to contact your site administrator for access.

#. Browse to the content item you wish to add a comment to.

#. Locate the *Comments* section at the bottom of the page. Depending on how
   long your page content is, you may need to scroll down the page.

#. Locate the comment that you wish to respond to and click the ``Delete``
   button against the comment.

#. The page will reload and show that the given comment has been removed.



Searching for content
=====================

|project-name| features a full-text search engine for quickly locating
documents and other content within the site.

   :alt: Search

Enter text in the search box, and press the :kbd:`Enter` or :kbd:`Return` key
on your keyboard.  The site will search for all content which includes that
string in either the metadata or the text of the content. This includes
aspects such as the title of documents, descriptions, tags, and even
full-text inside files such as PDFs and Microsoft Office documents.

.. important::
   The search results will only ever show items that you have access to.  This
   also applies when logged out. No private content will ever be revealed
   to users unless permission has been granted.

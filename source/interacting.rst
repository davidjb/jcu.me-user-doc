Comments are an important part of collaboration and allow you to provide
feedback or visibly expression opinions.

With the exception of folders, almost all types of content can be enabled to
allow comments. If comments are enabled for a particular content item you will
see a comments section underneath the content, and an ``Add comment`` button.
If this isn't visible, see `Enabling or disabling comments`_ for how to turn
commenting on.


Enabling or disabling comments
------------------------------

.. note::
    You requre access to edit a given content item in order to control comments.


#. Browse to the content item you wish to adjust comments for.

#. Click on the ``Edit`` tab.

#. Click onto the ``Settings`` tab on the page to reveal extra settings
   for this content.

#. Enable or disable the ``Allow comments`` field as required.

   If you can't find the field here, it might be under a different tab, such as
   ``Properties``. Some custom content types can adjust where options are
   displayed.

#. Click the ``Save`` button to make the change.

#. The page will reload and display your content with its new settings applied.


If you selected commenting to be enabled, the comments field will be displayed.
Likewise, if you selected commenting to be disabled, comments will no longer be
shown and the ability to add comments will be removed.


Adding comments
---------------

.. note::
   The content item you wish to add comments to must have commenting enabled
   first.

#. Browse to the content item you wish to add a comment to.

#. Locate the *Comments* section at the bottom of the page. Depending on how
   long your page content is, you may need to scroll down the page.

#. Type your comments in to the field provided.

#. To save the comment, click the *Comment*.

#. Your comments appear inline underneath the content.

Searching for content
=====================

|project-name| features a full-text search engine for quickly locating
documents and other content within the site.

.. image:: images/search.png
   :alt: Search

Enter text in the search box, and the site will search for all content
which includes that string in either the metadata or the text of the document.
This includes aspects such as the title of the content item, the description,
tags, and even full-text inside files such as PDFs and Microsoft Office
documents.

.. note::
   The search results will only ever show items that you have access to.  This
   also applies when logged out - no private content will ever be revealed.

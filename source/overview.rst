What is Plone?
**************

Introduction
============

Collaborative data sharing is a key area of interest for many researchers and
graduate students. This portal provides a web-based solution for managing data
and file storage, messaging, project management and more.

This site uses an open-source content management system called
`Plone <http://www.plone.org>`_ to allow researchers to easily share content,
files and other digital objects within a web environment without needing to
learn web authoring technologies.

Researchers can use Plone as an access point to data and file storage,
collaboration and project management tools. Plone provides a simple method to
upload files and annotate them with comments between users.


Site Layout: An Introduction
=================================
.. Details about how the site is laid out and what features are available.

**Top navigation tabs** 
   The top navigation tabs are the top-level of navigation on the portal. 
   Primary folders or other types of content can be added or changed here 
   with appropriate permissions. For the public or normal users, however, 
   these serve as a quick way to access the main areas of information on 
   the portal. 
**Content management tools** 
   Here you will find tools for editing and viewing documents to which 
   you have access. If you don't see this bar of tabs, then you don't have 
   access to perform any actions on the given piece of content that you're 
   looking at. 
**Plone menu bar** 
   Contains the menus for adding new content to folders, or otherwise 
   setting how a piece of content is displayed or the workflow state of an 
   item. 
**LiveSearch** 
   A dynamic search engine that automatically updates the search results 
   as you type a string in the search box. 
**Main page content** 
   The main area on the page for your content. If you are looking at folder, 
   you might see a listing of folder contents here instead, rather than just
   a single page. Otherwise, you'll see the details about the current piece
   of content you're looking at. 
**Portlets** 
   Small mini 'windows' of information that are typically configured to 
   display snippets of information from another area on the site. One such 
   example is a 'News' portlet, which aggregates information from the 'News'
   section of the site. 
**Personal bar** 
   Contains links for logging in and out, access to your folder and your 
   personal preferences for display of the site. 
**Site links** 
   Contains general site links of importance.\Some of these may change 
   depending on your access rights.

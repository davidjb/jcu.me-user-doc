may find there. By default the content will appear under the view tab in the

     modified, state and order

     renamed or deleted

     See :ref:`setting-the-document-metadata` section for more info.

.. _setting-the-document-metadata:

Setting the document metadata
=============================

Document metadata is very important: the portal and your users needs to know
extra information about your content.

Each item on a Plone portal has specific properties called\"metadata" that are
associated with it. These metadata allow documents to be found easily via
searches and other queries to the system.

Keep in mind that metadata available will vary from one content type to
another. However, in general you will find the following values across the
different content types in the system:

+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| Metadata             | Description                                          |
+======================+======================================================+
| **Title**            | The title of the item                                |
+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| **Description**      | A short, one paragraph description of the item       |
+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| **File**             | The source file for the item                         |
+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| **Body text**        | You can cut and paste this in from other documents,  |
|                      | or type it in using the Plone editor.                |
+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| **Related items**    | Links to files already on the Plone system.          |
+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| **Allow discussion** | The default is to enable discussion, this can be     |
|                      | turned off                                           |
+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| **Change note**      | Enter a comment below to describe the changes you've |
|                      | made.                                                |
+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+


.. _setting-advanced-metadata-properties:

Setting advanced metadata properties
====================================

You can control your content even further with advanced metadata properties.

In order to aid the advanced searching capabilities of Plone, you can add
additional metadata to describe your item. To add this metadata, edit your
content, and look for these extra tabs:

   :alt: Extra tabs

The extra metadata items are described below. Keep in mind that some of these
aspects won't appear on all content types, or might appear under different tabs.

+-------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Metadata                | Description                                    |

|                         | added first                                    |
+-------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Effective Date          | Can be used to delay making the content        |
|                         | available                                      |

|                         | available                                      |
+-------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Language                | By default, Plone is language neutral          |
+-------------------------+------------------------------------------------+

+-------------------------+------------------------------------------------+


Creating a table of contents
============================
.. A table of contents is a quick and easy way of helping your users navigate.

If your page is lengthy, you may wish to add a table of contents with links to
each section of the page.\This is easy to do, as long as you follow a few
simple steps.


To create a table of contents
-----------------------------

* Create the page as normal, typing or pasting in the content
* Divide your content up according to sections, using the *Heading* style from
  the drop-down menu to set your headings accordingly.
* If you have sub-sections, use the *Subheading* style from the drop-down menu
  to set your subheadings accordingly.
* Do this for all sections of the document. These headings and subheadings
  will appear as entries automatically in your table of contents.
* Before closing your document, click the **Settings**  tab at the top of the
  page. 
* Place a tick in the **Table of Contents** checkbox
* Click the **Save**  button at the bottom of the page to save your page. 

You should now have a table of contents at the right side of your lengthy
page. Users can click onto entries in the table of contents to jump to those
sections instantly.


Creating public content
=======================
.. Whilst having space for personal content is helpful, you usually want to
   also publish content to the public.

**Note:**  All content management is done in-place, unlike some other
content management systems.\Essentially, where you put the content is where
it'll appear.

1. Login to the portal and navigate to the folder where you would like to
   create the page.
2. Click Add New and choose your content type from the menu
3. Create the page or content as usual
4. Click onto the Save button to save your content.
5. Click onto the **State**  menu and choose **Publish**  from the list.

  1. If you can't see this, then you don't have access to publish documents.
  2. You might see 'Submit for publication' under the menu instead. If you
     see this, click this and it will submit the content to your section
     administrator for approval.
  3. In any case, you'll need to contact your site or section administrator
     for access or to get them to publish the content for you.

User documentation
==================

Install
-------

To install all dependencies and then build the actual documentation, do
the following::
  
    python boostrap.py
    ./bin/buildout
    ./bin/sphinxbuilder

To re-build the documentation, just run::

    ./bin/sphinxbuilder

The final path of the rendered documentation is described in the console 
output.
